Not enjoying any of the knob selections.  volume_only will work, I guess.

I trried knob_only, but found myself stuck in deep menus.  That happened in some other selections too.

I thought volume,longpress would work nicely, but (a) I got stuck in it, too, and (b) it liked to pause on the first longpress.

May be reasonable to just get a control panel wired and play with mappings once buttons are recognized.

Oh: let's try buttons for volup/down to see hardware...

OK. Getting volup on GPIO4, but naught on GPIO21... looks like it was a problem with the breadboard connection. Connecting on column d worked.
